# VR Chat Cache Cleaner

Running this will clear the cache folder within your VR Chat appdata directory.

The purpose of this is because VR Chat likes to store large amounts of cached files within your C:\ drive, whether or not your game is installed on the C drive or not.

Running this once after every few sessions can potentially save gigabytes in space.

This script is free to use and you may re-distribute it/modify it the way you'd like. If you wish to give credit that's all on you to decide.

I have also re-created this script for cleaning FiveM cache, if that interests you take a look at https://github.com/DishwasherDev/FiveM-Cache-Cleaner.git
