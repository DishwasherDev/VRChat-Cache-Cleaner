# VR Chat Cache Cleaner

Running this will clear the cache folder within your VR Chat appdata directory.

The purpose of this is because VR Chat likes to store large amounts of cached files within your C:\ drive, whether or not your game is installed on the C drive or not.

Running this once after every few sessions can potentially save gigabytes in space.
